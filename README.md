<h1 align='center'> Pattern Recognition </h1> 

<p> This repository showcases my hands-on work with algorithms used in pattern recognition, developed during my course at UFMG. 

Projects were developed for the course Introduction to Pattern Recognition offered by the Department of Electronic Engineering at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), taken as an elective.
